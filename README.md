# Masters Project
Thesis for my masters degree. 

Abstract:
In this project, we seek to understand some of the risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) by examining notes from psychotherapy sessions. SI is thinking about, considering, or planning suicide without suicidal behavior.  While having SI is not always a strong predictor of death by suicide, it is still important to understand because it negatively affects the quality of life for students.  We used natural language processing and machine learning to determine how well psychotherapy notes predict self-reported SI. We looked at common co-occurring words for therapy sessions in which the students report high SI and found increases in the word depression result in a higher probability of high SI. Conversely, we found that an increase of the word anxiety resulted in a lower probability of high SI.

I don't include the code or data in this repository for privacy reasons, but I include the project write-up which describes the methods I used to analyze the data.
