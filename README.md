# Masters Project
Thesis for my masters degree. In this project, I analyzed data from the BYU Counseling Center to determine factors that can predict suicidal ideation. Two machine learning techniques were used to analyze the data: natural language processing, and extreme gradien boosting (xgboost).

I don't include the code or data in this repository for privacy reasons, but I include the project write-up which describes the methods I used to analyze the data.
